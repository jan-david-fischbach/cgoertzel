# `cgoertzel` - a Goertzel algorithm written in C with a NumPy wrapper

This contains a simple implementation of a Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT). The implementation uses what is known as
> 'Generalized Goertzel algorithm with shortened iteration loop'

This term comes from the paper
> [Sysel and Rajmic: Goertzel algorithm generalized to non-integer multiples of fundamental frequency. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing 2012 2012:56](https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-56/)

More polished information will be added over time.
